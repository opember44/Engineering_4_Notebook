This assinemngt made you instal Beagle Term and make it say hello world. Beagle Term was easy to install and reminded me of termux. 
## Get Your Pi Online
![Pi Online](images/pi_online.png)
### Reflection
I had no problems getting my pi online and connected to my wifi but I had many issues creating the Python folder in my Engineering 4 Notebook Repository. Prior to this assigmnet I had named this repository "Python" instead of Engineering 4 Notebook, so after I got my pi online I went to change the name of the repository so that I could then add my Python folder. This caused a lot of issues, what was shown in git hub and what was shown in Beagle term did not line up, I had an Engineering 4 Notebook within an Engineering 4 Notebook, and i couldn't push my commits. 
## Hello Python
![Dice Roller](images/dice_roller.png)
### Reflection
In this assignment I created an automatic dice roller. The user presses enter and a number between 1 and 6 is displayed. Then the user presses x to quit the game. My first big problem was that I created this assigment under the wrong name and then had to re do the assignemnt becasue i didn't know how to change the assignment from dice_roller.pi to dice_roller.py. My other problem was that I forogt to put a colon on while go == "y" and then it wouldn't work.
