This assinemngt made you instal Beagle Term and make it say hello world. Beagle Term was easy to install and reminded me of termux. 
## Get Your Pi Online

### Reflection
I had no problems getting my pi online and connected to my wifi but I had many issues creating the Python folder in my Engineering 4 Notebook Repository. Prior to this assigmnet I had named this repository "Python" instead of Engineering 4 Notebook, so after I got my pi online I went to change the name of the repository so that I could then add my Python folder. This caused a lot of issues, what was shown in git hub and what was shown in Beagle term did not line up, I had an Engineering 4 Notebook within an Engineering 4 Notebook, and i couldn't push my commits.
