## Hello Raspberry Pi

### Reflection
This assinemngt made you instal Beagle Term and make it say hello world. Beagle Term was easy to install and reminded me of termux. 
## Get Your Pi Online
![Pi Online](images/pi_online.png)
### Reflection
I had no problems getting my pi online and connected to my wifi but I had many issues creating the Python folder in my Engineering 4 Notebook Repository. Prior to this assigmnet I had named this repository "Python" instead of Engineering 4 Notebook, so after I got my pi online I went to change the name of the repository so that I could then add my Python folder. This caused a lot of issues, what was shown in git hub and what was shown in Beagle term did not line up, I had an Engineering 4 Notebook within an Engineering 4 Notebook, and i couldn't push my commits. 
## Hello Python
![Dice Roller](images/dice_roller.png)
### Reflection
In this assignment I created an automatic dice roller. The user presses enter and a number between 1 and 6 is displayed. Then the user presses x to quit the game. My first big problem was that I created this assigment under the wrong name and then had to re do the assignemnt becasue i didn't know how to change the assignment from dice_roller.pi to dice_roller.py. My other problem was that I forogt to put a colon on while go == "y" and then it wouldn't work.
## Python Program 01 - Calculator
![Calculator](images/calculator.png)
### Reflection
In this assigment I created a calculator that asks the user to enter two numbers and then it adds, subtracts, multiplies, divides, and finds the remainder of the two numbers. The first problem i ran into was that it said my lines that used "operation" were undefined and I didn't know why. It turned out that I had written operations not operation. The next problem i had was that I forogt to use double equal signs on my while and if functions. On this assignment it would have been helpful to be able to copy and paste becasue you are wwriting the same line multiple times with only a small difference so if you could copy and paste then just edit the line you pasted in it would make the assingment much faster, but I do not know how to copy and paste in beagle term.
## Python Program 02 - Quadratic Solver
![Quadratic Solver](images/quadratic_solver.png)
### Reflection
In this assignment we had to create a program that could solve quadratic equations and find their real roots or say no real roots. It asks the user to enter three variables then it solves the equations and finds the roots. This assigment was similar to the previous one but more challeneging. At first I didn't understand what it mean when it said "an array of the two roots" so i was confused on what the assigment meant. Wikipedia told me that "In computer science, an array data structure, or simply an array, is a data structure consisting of a collection of elements, each identified by at least one array index or key."
